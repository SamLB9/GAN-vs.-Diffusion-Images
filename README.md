## ðŸ“– Abstract

Generative models such as **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)** and **diffusion models** are capable of producing images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic photographs. This progress raises concerns regarding **digital authenticity, misinformation, and deepfake detection**.  

In this work, we perform a **comparative analysis of GAN- and diffusion-generated images** using handcrafted statistical features. Four feature categories are extracted:  
- **Color distributions**  
- **Noise patterns**  
- **Frequency statistics**  
- **Texture & structure embeddings**  

Random Forest classifiers are trained on different training regimes to assess **cross-architecture generalization** (e.g., training on GANs and testing on Diffusion, and vice versa).  

Key findings:  
- **Noise and frequency-domain features** consistently outperform color and texture for distinguishing real from synthetic images.  
- Training with **Real + Diffusion** provides stronger generalization to unseen GANs compared to the opposite.  
- Diffusion models appear to partially recover mid-frequency structures absent in GANs, but still fail to replicate authentic sensor noise.  

These results highlight the importance of handcrafted, lightweight descriptors as **robust, model-agnostic tools for deepfake detection**.
